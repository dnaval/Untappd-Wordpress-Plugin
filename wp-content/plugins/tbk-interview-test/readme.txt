Need: They want to stay on top of reviews of their flagship, award-winning beer: Spruce Beer. The idea is to create a simple, one-page dashboard for their beer data, ratings, and latest reviews.

Beer URL: https://untappd.com/b/garrison-brewing-company-spruce-beer/110569

Requirements:

- A webpage that lists the 10 most recent reviews for Spruce Beer.
 -- For each review display the name, date, rating.
- On that same webpage, display the beer details:
 -- Brewery Name
 -- Beer Name
 -- Beer Style
 -- Alcohol Content
 -- IBU (Bitterness)
 -- Average Rating (out of 5)
 -- Display Picture of beer if available
 -- Display Brewery logo if available
